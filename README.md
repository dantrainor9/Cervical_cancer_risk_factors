# Cervical_cancer_risk_factors
Data was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning repository, original survey conducted at Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. Each column represents a question on a survey, each row represents one participant's responses. This is a classification project to build a model able to predict whether a person will have a positive diagnosis of cervical cancer based on risk factors. Four diagnostic tests were available as targets, Hinselman and Schiller tests, cytological examination, and biopsy. 

Some tree based models and neural networks both proved to have difficulty predicting the positive class (positive biopsy for cervical cancer). This is primarily due to class imbalances in the dataset. LGBClassifier and RandomForestClassifier both were able to classify correctly at least half of the positive class, based on F1 score, recall, and precision metrics.
