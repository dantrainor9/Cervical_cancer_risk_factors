# Cervical_cancer_risk_factors
Data was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning repository, original survey conducted at Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. Each column represents a question on a survey, each row represents one participant's responses. This is a classification project to build a model able to predict whether a person will have a positive diagnosis of cervical cancer based on risk factors. Four diagnostic tests were available as targets, Hinselman and Schiller tests, cytological examination, and biopsy. 

A neural network was chosen as a production model as tree based models had issues predicting the positive class in the target column, however imbalances in the dataset made these difficult to predict for the neural network as well.
