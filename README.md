# Cervical_cancer_risk_factors
Data was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning repository, original survey conducted at Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela. Each column represents a question on a survey, each row represents one participant's responses. This is a classification project to build a model able to predict whether a person will have a positive diagnosis of cervical cancer based on risk factors. Four diagnostic tests were available as targets, Hinselman and Schiller tests, cytological examination, and biopsy.
